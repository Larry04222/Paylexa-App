# Paylexa Branding Assets

This directory centralises reusable brand primitives for the Paylexa ecosystem. Update these files when the design system evolves so that backend generated emails, web, admin and mobile clients can source the same palette and guidelines.

## Palette

- Dark Gold `#C9A227`
- Black `#0B0B0C`
- White `#FFFFFF`
- Emerald `#0FA77A`
- Royal Blue `#1B3B93`

## Usage Notes

- Prefer gradients that blend Dark Gold â†’ Emerald for premium hero surfaces.
- Maintain at least 4.5:1 contrast for text using Black/White pairings.
- Phoenix "Morphon" animations should be subtle, looping under 6 seconds.
